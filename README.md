def test_booking():
    # Initialize WebDriver
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
    driver.get("http://localhost:5500/index.html")  # Replace with your hosted URL if applicable

    # Scroll to Services Section
    services_section = driver.find_element(By.ID, "services")
    driver.execute_script("arguments[0].scrollIntoView();", services_section)
    time.sleep(1)

    # Click "Book Now" for a service
